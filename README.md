<h2>Hey 👋, I'm Hamza Görgülü</h2>
<p>I graduated from Yıldız Technical University with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. My bachelor's thesis focused on Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Among Smart Homes, and I developed a MILP model and an interactive visual interface for monitoring and reducing residential energy bills. This research has been published in SEGAN, Elsevier.</p>
<p>I am now pursuing a master's degree as a project student in the COMP department at Koç University, where I work on the KUTEM(Koç Üniv. Tüpraş Enerji Merkezi) project. This project uses NLP techniques to predict upcoming alarms in TUPRAS refineries, and I develop algorithms for preprocessing and filtering alarm data and for forecasting future alarms.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy jogging and swimming to keep myself fit and healthy. You can find me on LinkedIn and feel free to ping me about anything related to deep learning and computer engineering.</p>
